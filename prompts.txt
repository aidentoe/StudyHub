I want you to design and develop a website for students that helps them in multiple ways and keeps them on track with their studies by including a wide range of features commonly found in study and productivity platforms. The site should have tools for studying such as digital flashcards, practice quizzes with instant feedback, note summarization, subject breakdowns, and learning resource recommendations; collaboration features like discussion forums, group chats, study group scheduling, peer-to-peer tutoring, and the ability to share notes; productivity tools including a calendar with deadlines and reminders, a study planner, to-do lists, and progress tracking; motivation and support elements such as gamification (badges, points, streaks), motivational tips, a Pomodoro or focus timer, and a mental health resources section; customization options like dark/light mode, customizable dashboards, accessibility features (text-to-speech, dyslexia-friendly fonts, adjustable text sizes), and mobile responsiveness; and finally, extra integrations such as Google Drive and Calendar connections, an AI writing assistant for essays, a citation generator, and a homework upload tool that allows students to snap pictures and receive help. The website should be modern, user-friendly, engaging, and serve as an all-in-one hub where students can learn, collaborate, stay productive, and track their academic progress.
